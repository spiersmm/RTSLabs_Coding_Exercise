# RTSLabs_Coding_Exercise
This repository contains the code and answers to the three questions requested by RTS Labs. </br>
The answer to each question is located in its respective folder: Problem #1, Problem #2, or Problem #3.

### Questions
1. Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

2. Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.
